This project uses file data to put together a web of paths between cities. This information is used to find all paths and the best path between cities. Made using C# and Windows Forms. The main point of the project is the widespread use of different data structures, such as: graph, tree, binary tree, array, stack and multidimensional array.

This is an version of an existing project (https://github.com/edumigueis/Mars-Map-Router) with some improvements, such as adding AVL tree data structure and Dijkstra Algorithm. In addition to usability adjustments.

## Installation

Download the project and run the .exe file. Or, open the project in your prefered .NET Framework IDE and run it there. 

## Usage example

This project uses really interesting algorithms like backtracking and recursion in binary trees. This implementations can be used in a lot of situations, especially when dealing with locations and paths overall.
